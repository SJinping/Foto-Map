# Foto-Map

Show OneDrive Photos on Google Map

This app originated from [OneDriveExplorer](https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-explorer-js) and [Instagram-Map](https://github.com/yenhao/Instagram-Map).

This sample illustrates the basic concepts for interacting with the OneDrive API and Google Map to display photos.

Included in this project:

* Foto-Map (index.html) - A sample web app to show the photos from OneDrive on Google Map.
* ODAuth (odauth.js) - A simple js library for handling the OAuth2 implicit grant flow for OneDrive.
* Display Photos (app.js) - A simple js for handling photos showing.

When use the project, you must get your own **clientID** and **redirectedURL** (for accessing OneDrive accound), and your own Google Map key. They are used in index.html.
